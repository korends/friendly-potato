                            Hello there! My name is Koren. I'm a 26 year-old aspiring web developer in New Jersey. While
                            taking this web developer boot camp, I am working full time as a Digital Marketing
                            Coordinator. It's funny I ended up taking up a developer course because I didn't really like
                            my C++ class in
                            college. But I chalk that up to the fact that I didn't really like my professor! HA.
